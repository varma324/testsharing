Fuzzy searching in Databricks SQL can be achieved using similarity functions like `levenshtein` and `soundex`, along with custom scoring. Here's an example of how to perform a fuzzy search and assign a score to text fields and names in Databricks SQL: 1. **Levenshtein Distance**: Measures the number of single-character edits required to change one word into the other. 2. **Soundex**: Encodes words into a four-character string to match similar sounding words. Below is an example query that combines both methods to perform fuzzy searching and scoring: ```sql -- Sample table creation for demonstration CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS sample_data ( id INT, name STRING ); INSERT INTO sample_data VALUES (1, 'John Smith'), (2, 'Jon Smythe'), (3, 'Johnny Smithe'), (4, 'Jane Doe'), (5, 'Janet Do'); -- Fuzzy search query with scoring WITH search_data AS ( SELECT id, name, levenshtein(name, 'John Smith') AS levenshtein_score, soundex(name) AS name_soundex FROM sample_data ) SELECT id, name, levenshtein_score, CASE WHEN name_soundex = soundex('John Smith') THEN 1.0 -- High score for soundex match ELSE 0.0 END AS soundex_score, (1.0 / (1 + levenshtein_score)) + CASE WHEN name_soundex = soundex('John Smith') THEN 1.0 -- Adjust score combining both metrics ELSE 0.0 END AS final_score FROM search_data ORDER BY final_score DESC; ``` ### Explanation: 1. **Table Creation**: A sample table `sample_data` is created and populated with sample names. 2. **Search Data**: A common table expression (CTE) `search_data` is used to calculate the `levenshtein` distance and `soundex` for each name against the search term ('John Smith'). 3. **Scoring**: - `levenshtein_score` is calculated directly. - `soundex_score` is a binary score indicating if the `soundex` value matches. - `final_score` is a combination of both scores, adjusted to prioritize matches with similar sounds. You can adjust the scoring logic based on your requirements and use more advanced techniques if needed.
